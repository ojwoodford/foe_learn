# foe_learn

MATLAB and C++ code for learning Fields of Experts parameters from a set of patches, using the method described in the paper:

"Fields of Experts for Image-based Rendering", O. J. Woodford, I. D. Reid, P. H. S. Torr, A. W. Fitzgibbon, BMVC 2006.

The (C++) mex file is compiled automatically by the software (assuming you have a compiler installed).

You may wish to add code to indicate progress and also to record the change in model parameters over time, in order to get a sense of the convergence.
